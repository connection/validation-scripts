validation-scripts
==================

Various scripts for validating pentest findings

Note that many of these tools/scripts were created on the fly and are missing documentation. I will do my best to add documentation to each tool as I get time. Feel free to open issues for tools that need documentation so I can have a way of tracking things I've missed
